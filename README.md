# SORTWebCalc

The Surgical Outcome Risk Tool is a perioperative risk prediction tool.

This [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) `R` app is a browser-based calculator for computing the risks of perioperative morbidity and mortality according to the [SORT](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9638) and [SORT-morbidity](https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aex117) models.

A previous version of this app, which is only able to compute SORT-morbidity risks exists in this [repository](https://github.com/dannyjnwong/SORTMorbidityWebCalc), and its online implementation exists [here](https://dannyjnwong.shinyapps.io/SORTMorbidityWebCalc).
