This resource is not intended to be used in isolation for clinical decision making and should not replace the advice of a healthcare professional about the potential risks or benefits of a planned procedure. The author of this calculator will not be held responsible for decisions made by healthcare professionals or patients which are based on the estimates provided by the SORT, as these estimates are provided only for the purposes of background information."),
